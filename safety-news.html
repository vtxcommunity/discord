Discord is partnering with <a href="https://www.crisistextline.org/">Crisis Text Line</a>, a nonprofit that provides 24/7 text-based mental health support and crisis intervention via trained volunteer Crisis Counselors.<br/><br/>If you report a message for self-harm within the Discord mobile app, you will be presented with information on how to connect with a Crisis Text Line volunteer Crisis Counselor. You can also text ‘DISCORD’ to 741741 to reach Crisis Text Line counselors available 24/7 to help you or a friend through any mental health crisis. Our goal is to enable users to get the help they need for themselves, or empower others to get help, as quickly as possible.</p><p>Crisis Text Line is <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/7925648993943-Crisis-Text-Line">available</a> to those in the United States and is offered in both English and Spanish.</p></div><div class="w-richtext"><h2>Supporting Youth Digital Wellness</h2><p>We’re constantly improving and expanding our approach to teen safety and wellbeing on Discord. That’s why we’re proud to support the <a href="https://digitalwellnesslab.org/">Digital Wellness Lab</a> at Boston Children’s Hospital to help ground our approach to teen safety and belonging in the latest scientific research and best practices. The Digital Wellness Lab at Boston Children’s Hospital convenes leaders in technology, scientific research, healthcare, child development, media, entertainment, and education to deepen understanding and address the future of how young people can engage healthily with media and technology. We’re excited to work with the Digital Wellness Lab to help develop ways to better support teen mental health, both online and off.</p></div><div class="w-richtext"><h2>Empowering Teens and Families to Build Belonging</h2><p>Back-to-school season is a great time for families to rethink and reset their relationship with technology. To help out, Discord is rolling out a new <a href="https://www.pta.org/home/programs/connected/build-belonging">program</a> with National PTA to help families and educators discuss ways to foster positive relationships and build belonging in our digital world. Through the program, free resources will be provided, along with breakout activities and digital safety tips for families. As part of National PTA’s PTA Connected program, Discord will also fund 30 grants for local high school PTAs to pilot the program during the 2022–2023 school year. </p><p>Parents, want some help starting a conversation about digital safety with your family or at your school? Check out National PTA’s <a href="https://www.pta.org/home/programs/connected/build-belonging">PTA Connected page</a> for everything you need.</p></div><div class="w-richtext"><h2>Expanding Our Policies </h2><p>Beyond our work with Crisis Text Line, Digital Wellness Lab, and National PTA, we continue to build out efforts and resources that help people on Discord build belonging and support one another to overcome the impossible. Finding a community that is navigating similar challenges can be incredibly helpful for healing. </p><p>That said, platforms have a critical role to play to ensure these digital spaces don’t attempt to normalize or promote hurtful behaviors or encourage other users to engage in acts of self-harm. We recently expanded our Self Harm Encouragement and Promotion Policy to ensure this type of content is addressed on Discord. We do not allow any content or behavior that promotes or encourages individuals to commit acts of self-harm on Discord. We also prohibit content that seeks to normalize self-harming behaviors, as well as content that discourages individuals from seeking help for self-harm behaviors. </p><p>We’re committed to mental wellbeing and helping our users uplift each other and their communities. Our newly-implemented partnerships and resources developed with the support of the Crisis Text Line, Digital Wellness Lab, and National PTA are an important addition to our ongoing work to give everyone the power to create space to find belonging in their lives.</p></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div></div></div><div role="listitem" class="article_item w-dyn-item"><div data-w-id="bda883a0-f35d-54dc-c9d8-9a948cf6ba8a" class="academy_lesson-item"><div class="category_name w-dyn-bind-empty"></div><div class="academy_lesson-wr safety"><div id="w-node-f756a1bd-5d4e-c3f9-b614-be1730d80967-d9fcf281" class="creator-card-image-wrapper safety"><img src="../assets-global.website-files.com/625fe439fb70a9d901e138ab/6536b79d1344fe92a5e86f38_Safety%2bPrivacy_Banner_01.png" loading="lazy" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 90vw, 280px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/625fe439fb70a9d901e138ab/6536b79d1344fe92a5e86f38_Safety%2BPrivacy_Banner_01-p-500.png 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/625fe439fb70a9d901e138ab/6536b79d1344fe92a5e86f38_Safety%2BPrivacy_Banner_01-p-800.png 800w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/625fe439fb70a9d901e138ab/6536b79d1344fe92a5e86f38_Safety%2BPrivacy_Banner_01-p-1080.png 1080w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/625fe439fb70a9d901e138ab/6536b79d1344fe92a5e86f38_Safety%2BPrivacy_Banner_01-p-1600.png 1600w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/625fe439fb70a9d901e138ab/6536b79d1344fe92a5e86f38_Safety%2BPrivacy_Banner_01.png 1800w" class="creator-card_image safety"/></div><div id="w-node-_6c63ba4f-4953-51fe-5d73-9782abcbcba6-d9fcf281" class="safety-item-content"><div class="text-blue safety w-dyn-bind-empty"></div><h2 style="color:rgb(44,47,51)" class="ginto-700-32 left-creator safety card-title">Building a Safer Place for Teens to Hang Out</h2><div class="w-dyn-list"><div role="list" class="creator_topics-list w-dyn-items"><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><a href="safeties-topics/parents-and-teens.html" class="topic_item w-inline-block"><div>Parents and Teens</div></a></div></div></div></div></div><a href="safety/safer-place-for-teens.html" class="academy_lesson-card"></a></div><div class="item-content"><div class="w-richtext"><h3><strong>Choose what you see and who you want to hang with</strong></h3><p>Introducing our new <strong>Teen Safety Assist</strong> initiative: Teen Safety Assist is focused on further protecting teens by introducing a new series of features, including multiple safety alerts and sensitive content filters that will be default enabled for teen users.</p><p>Starting next week, we’re excited to release the first two features of the Teen Safety Assist initiative. Teens have shared that they like tools that help them avoid unwanted direct messages (DMs) and media. To support this, we’re rolling out <strong>safety alerts on senders</strong> and <strong>sensitive content filters</strong> that automatically blur media that may be sensitive — even if the sender doesn’t initially blur it with a spoiler tag. </p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Safety alerts on senders: </strong>When a teen receives a DM from a user for the first time, Discord will detect if a safety alert should be sent to the teen for this DM. The safety alert will encourage them to double check if they want to reply, and will provide links to block the user or view more safety tips to safeguard themselves.</li><li><strong>Sensitive content filters: </strong>For teens, Discord will automatically blur media that may be sensitive in direct messages and group direct messages with friends, as well as in servers. The blur creates an extra step to encourage teens to use caution when viewing the media. In User Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Safety, teens will be able to change their sensitive media preferences at any time. Anyone can opt into these filters by going to their Privacy &amp; Safety settings page and changing their sensitive media preferences.</li></ul><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center" style="padding-bottom:33.723653395784545%" class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-video"><div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kw1rKOo6cWA" title="Discord Teen Safety Assist"></iframe></div></figure><p>‍</p><p>We’ve partnered with technology non-profit <a href="https://www.thorn.org/">Thorn</a> to design these features together based on their guidance on teen online safety behaviors and what works best to help protect teens. Our partnership has focused on empowering teens to take control over safety and how best to guide teens to helpful tips and resources.</p><p>We’re grateful for the support of Thorn to ensure we build the right protections and empower teens with the tools and resources they need to have a safer online experience.</p><p>The first two features of the Teen Safety initiative will start rolling out globally in November 2023 and will be turned on by default for teen users. Stay tuned for many more features from this initiative as we look ahead to the next year.</p></div><div class="w-richtext"><h3>Work together to keep each other safe</h3><p>We know mistakes happen and rules are accidentally broken. Our new Warning System includes multiple touchpoints so users can easily understand rule violations and the consequences. These touchpoints provide more transparency into Discord interventions, letting users know how their violation may impact their overall account standing and gives information for them to do better in the future.</p><p>We built this system so users can learn how to do better in the future and help keep all hangouts safe. </p><ul role="list"><li><strong>It starts with a DM</strong> - Users who break the rules will receive an in-app message directly from Discord letting them know they received either a warning or a violation, based on the severity of what happened and whether or not Discord has taken action. </li><li><strong>Details are one click away </strong>- From that message, users will be guided to a detailed modal that, in many cases, will give details of the post that broke our rules, outline actions taken and/or account restrictions, and more info regarding the specific Discord policy or Community Guideline that was violated.</li><li><strong>All info is streamlined in your account standing</strong> - In Privacy &amp; Safety settings, all information about past violations can be seen in the new “Account Standing” tab. A user’s account standing is determined based on any active violations and the severity of those violations.</li></ul><p>Some violations are more serious than others, and we’ll take appropriate action depending on the severity of the violation. For example, we have and will continue to have a zero-tolerance policy towards violent extremism and content that sexualizes children.</p><p>The Warning System is built based on <a href="safety/commitment-to-teen-child-safety.html">our teen-centric policies</a>. This is a multi-year, focused effort to invest more deeply and holistically into our teen safety efforts. We incorporate teen-centric philosophies in how we enforce our policies, assess risks of new products with Safety by Design, and communicate our policies in an age-appropriate manner.</p><p>For the Warning System, this means that we consider how teens are growing, learning, and taking age-appropriate risks as they mature, and we give them more opportunities to learn from mistakes rather than punish them harshly.</p><p>The Warning System starts rolling out today in select regions. Stay tuned for many more updates to our Warning System in the future.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type-video w-richtext-align-center" style="padding-bottom:33.723653395784545%" class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-video"><div><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U6AlbG2ZoKs" title="Discord Warning System"></iframe></div></figure><p>‍</p><p><strong>For our server moderators and admins</strong>, we’ve recently expanded their safety toolkit with new features that allow them to proactively identify potentially unsafe activity, such as server raids and DM spam, and take swift actions as needed. </p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Activity Alerts and Security Actions: </strong>Activity Alerts notify moderators of a server of abnormal server behavior, particularly what could be massive raids or unusual DM activity. From there, they can investigate further and take action to protect their community as necessary. If it doesn’t seem like an issue, they can easily resolve the alert. Security Actions enable swift server lockdowns by surfacing useful tools quicker, such as temporarily halting new member joins or closing off DMs between non-friend server members.</li><li><strong>Members Page: </strong>We’ve reimagined the existing Members page, letting moderators view their members in a more organized way. The Members page now displays relevant safety information about their members like join date, account age, and safety-related flags that we call Signals (such as unusual DM activity or timed out users). We plan on continuing to develop and surface additional relevant Signals. This redesigned Members page appears in a more easily accessible spot above their server’s channel list. </li></ul><p><br/>We began rolling these tools in September to Community Servers, and now we’re rolling them out to all servers.</p></div><div class="w-richtext"><h3><strong>You choose what stays private</strong></h3><p>While you might be an open book with your friends, having your personal business out there for everyone to see can feel a bit weird.

The cases at issue (<em>Moody v. NetChoice, et al.</em> and <em>NetChoice et al. v. Paxton</em>) challenge the constitutionality of two new laws in Texas and Florida. You may have heard of them: these laws would significantly restrict the ability of online services to remove content that is objectionable  to their users and force them to keep a wide range of “lawful but awful” content on their sites. Discord is not a traditional social media service, but whether intended or not, the laws are broad enough to likely impact services like ours.</p><p>It’s hard to overstate the potential impact if these laws are allowed to go into effect: they would fundamentally change how services like Discord operate, and with that, the experiences we deliver to you. There’s no doubt that the outcome here is hugely important to us as a company, but that alone is not why we are taking a stand. Ultimately, we filed this brief because important context was missing from the official record: you all and the vibrant communities you’ve built on Discord.</p><p>Taking a step back, Discord has invested heavily in creating safe and fun online spaces. Our <a href="guidelines.html">Community Guidelines</a> set the rules for how we all engage on Discord, and we put a lot of effort into enforcing them: around 15% of the company works on safety, including content moderation. This includes Trust and Safety agents who enforce Discord’s rules, engineers who develop moderation tools for both Discord and its users, and many more dedicated individuals across our company.</p><p>We do this work so that you can create those online spaces where you can find and foster genuine connection. But in order to bring this world to life, Discord needs to be able to prevent, detect, and remove harmful speech and conduct. Barring companies like Discord from moderating content is a little like barring garbage collection in a city: every individual block would have to devote its own resources to hauling its own garbage, diverting those limited resources from more productive activities and the individualized curation that makes each neighborhood unique. So, while our rules and content moderation efforts certainly reflect our own values and speech about the kind of services we want to offer, we really do it for you all—we work to take care of the hard stuff so you all can focus on creating the communities you want.</p><p>That’s why we decided to take such a strong position in these cases: we want to make sure the Supreme Court understands how these laws would impact your speech and your communities. Fortunately, the First Amendment has a lot to say about this–it protects your association rights, which make it possible for you to come together around your shared interests and see content that is relevant and helpful, not harmful. </p><p>Keeping your communities fun and safe by not allowing harmful content is a top priority for us. We wouldn’t be doing what we do without all of you, and we will keep working to make sure you can create the online spaces you want.  </p><p></p></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div></div></div><div role="listitem" class="article_item w-dyn-item"><div data-w-id="bda883a0-f35d-54dc-c9d8-9a948cf6ba8a" class="academy_lesson-item"><div class="category_name">Safety</div><div class="academy_lesson-wr safety"><div id="w-node-f756a1bd-5d4e-c3f9-b614-be1730d80967-d9fcf281" class="creator-card-image-wrapper safety"><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/625fe439fb70a9d901e138ab/649969cc5e8076ac3158fadd_2306_SCL_BlogHeader_5.svg" loading="lazy" alt="" class="creator-card_image safety"/></div><div id="w-node-_6c63ba4f-4953-51fe-5d73-9782abcbcba6-d9fcf281" class="safety-item-content"><div class="text-blue safety">Safety</div><h2 style="color:rgb(44,47,51)" class="ginto-700-32 left-creator safety card-title">Discord’s Commitment to Teen and Child Safety</h2><div class="w-dyn-list"><div role="list" class="creator_topics-list w-dyn-items"><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><a href="safeties-topics/parents-and-teens.html" class="topic_item w-inline-block"><div>Parents and Teens</div></a></div></div></div></div></div><a href="safety/commitment-to-teen-child-safety.html" class="academy_lesson-card"></a></div><div class="item-content"><div class="w-richtext"><h3><strong>Our Policies</strong></h3><p>You can read an overview of the following policies <a href="safety/child-safety-policy-explainer.html">here</a>.</p><p><strong>Teen Self-Endangerment Policy</strong></p><p>Teen self-endangerment is a nuanced issue that we do not take lightly. We want our teen users to be able to express themselves freely on Discord while also taking steps to ensure these users don’t engage in risky behaviors that might endanger their safety and well-being.</p><p>In order to help our teenage users stay safe, our policies state that users under the age of 18 are not allowed to send or access any sexually explicit content. Even when this kind of content is shared consensually between teens, there is a risk that self-generated sexual media can be saved and shared outside of their private conversations. We want to help our users avoid finding themselves in these situations.</p><p>In this context, we also believe that dating online can result in self-endangerment. Under this policy, teen dating servers are prohibited on Discord and we will take action against users who are engaging in this behavior. Additionally, older teens engaging in the grooming of a younger teen will be reviewed and actioned under our Inappropriate Sexual Conduct with Children and Grooming Policy.</p><p>Through our thorough work and partnership with a prominent child safety organization, we determined that we will, when possible, warn teens who have engaged in sexually explicit behavior before moving to a full ban. An example of this includes teens sharing explicit content with each other that is not their own content.</p><p><strong>Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) and Child Sexualization Policy</strong></p><p>Discord has a zero-tolerance policy for child sexual abuse, which does not have a place on our platform — or anywhere in society.</p><p>We do not allow CSAM on Discord, including AI-generated photorealistic CSAM. When such imagery is found, the imagery is reported to the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC). This ensures that the sexualization of children in any context is not normalized by bad actors.</p><p><strong>Inappropriate Sexual Conduct with Teens and Grooming Policy</strong></p><p>Discord has a zero-tolerance policy for inappropriate sexual conduct with children and grooming. Grooming is inappropriate sexual contact between adults and teens on the platform, with special attention given to predatory behaviors such as <a href="https://www.missingkids.org/theissues/onlineenticement">online enticement</a> and the sexual extortion of children, commonly referred to as “sextortion.” When we become aware of these types of incidents, we take appropriate action, including banning the accounts of offending adult users and reporting them to NCMEC, which subsequently works with local law enforcement. </p></div><div class="w-richtext"><h3><strong>How We Work to Keep Our Younger Users Safe</strong></h3><p>Our Safety team works hard to find and remove abhorrent, harmful content, and take action including banning the users responsible and engaging with the proper authorities.</p><p>Discord’s Safety by Design practice includes a risk assessment process during the product development cycle that helps identify and mitigate potential risks to user safety. We recognize that teens have unique vulnerabilities in online settings and this process allows us to better safeguard their experience. Through this process, we think carefully about how product features might disproportionately impact teens and consider whether the product facilitates more teen-to-adult interactions and/or any unintended harm. Our teams identify and strategize ways to mitigate safety risks with internal safety technology solutions during this process and through getting insight and recommendations from external partners.</p><p>Discord uses a mix of proactive and reactive tools to remove content that violates our policies, from the use of advanced technology like machine learning models and PhotoDNA image hashing to partnering with community moderators to uphold our policies and providing in-platform reporting mechanisms to surface violations.</p><p>Our <a href="terms.html">Terms of Service</a> require people to be over a minimum age (13, unless local legislation mandates an older age) to access our website. We use an age gate that asks users to provide their date of birth upon creating an account. If a user is reported as being under 13, we delete their account. Users can only appeal to restore their account by providing an official ID document to verify their age.  Additionally, we require that all age-restricted content is placed in a channel clearly labeled as age-restricted, which triggers an age gate, preventing users under 18 from accessing that content.</p><p>The <a href="safety/safer-place-for-teens.html">newest launches of safety products</a> are focused on helping to safeguard the teen experience with our safety alerts on senders that educate teens on ways they can control their experience and limit unwanted contact. Additionally, sensitive content filters provide additional controls for teens to blur or block unwanted content. Rather than assigning prescriptive solutions for teens, we aim to empower teens with respect for their agency, privacy, and decision-making power.</p><p>Additionally, we are expanding our own Trusted Reporter Network in collaboration with INHOPE for direct communication with expert third parties, including researchers, industry peers, and journalists for intelligence sharing.</p></div><div class="w-richtext"><h3>Our Technology Solutions</h3><p>Machine learning has proven to be an essential component of safety solutions at Discord. Since our acquisition of Sentropy, a leader in AI-powered moderation systems, we have continued to balance technology with the judgment and contextual assessment of highly trained employees, along with continuing to maintain our strong stance on user privacy.</p><p>Below is an overview of some of our key investments in technology:</p><p><strong>Teen Safety Assist: </strong>Teen Safety Assist is focused on further protecting teens by introducing a new series of features, including multiple safety alerts and sensitive content filters that will be default-enabled for teen users.</p><p><strong>Safety Rules Engine: </strong>The Safety Rules Engine allows our teams to evaluate user activities on the platform, including registrations, server joins, and other metadata. We then analyze patterns of problematic behavior to make informed decisions and take uniform actions like user challenges or bans.</p><p><strong>AutoMod: </strong>Automod is a powerful tool for community moderators to automatically filter unwanted messages with certain keywords, block profiles that may be impersonating a server admin or appear harmful to their server, and detect harmful messages using machine learning. This technology empowers community moderators to keep their communities safe without having to spend long hours manually reviewing and removing unwanted content on their servers.</p><p><strong>Visual safety platform: </strong>Discord has continued to invest in improving image classifiers for content such as sexual, gore, and violent media. With these, our machine learning models are being improved to reach higher precision detection rates with lower error rates and decrease teen exposure to potentially inappropriate and mature content. We proactively scan images uploaded to our platform using PhotoDNA to detect child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and report any CSAM content and perpetrators to NCMEC, who subsequently work with local law enforcement to take appropriate action.</p><p>Investing in technological advancements and tools to proactively detect CSAM and grooming is a key priority for us, and we have a dedicated team to handle related content. In Q2 2023, we proactively removed 99% of servers found to be hosting CSAM. You can find more information in Discord’s latest <a href="safety-transparency-reports/2023-q2.html">Transparency Report</a>.</p><p>There is constant innovation taking place within and beyond Discord to improve how companies can effectively scale and deliver content moderation. Our approach will continue to evolve as time goes on, as we’re constantly finding new ways to do better for our users.</p><p><strong>Partnerships</strong></p><p>We know that collaboration is important, and we’re continuously working with experts and partners so that we have a holistic and informed approach to combating the sexual exploitation of children. We’re grateful to collaborate with the Tech Coalition and NoFiltr to help young people stay safer on Discord. </p><p>With our new series of products under the Teen Safety Assist initiative, Discord has launched a safety alert for teens to help flag when a teen might want to double-check that they want to reply to a particular new direct message. We’ve partnered with technology non-profit <a href="https://www.thorn.org/">Thorn</a> to design these features together based on their guidance on teen online safety behaviors and what works best to help protect teens. Our partnership is focused on empowering teens to take control over safety and how best to guide teens to helpful tips and resources.</p></div><div class="w-richtext"><h3>Additional Resources</h3><p>Want to learn more about Discord’s safety work?

We evolved our Threats Policy to address threats of harm to others. Under this policy, we will take action against direct and indirect threats, veiled threats, those who encourage this behavior, and conditional statements to cause harm. </p><p>We also refined our Hate Speech Policy with input from a group of experts who study identity and intersectionality and came from a variety of different identities and backgrounds themselves. Under this policy, we define “hate speech” as any form of expression that denigrates, vilifies, or dehumanizes; promotes intense, irrational feelings of enmity or hatred; or incites harm against people based on protected characteristics. </p><p>In addition, we’ve expanded our list of protected characteristics to go beyond what most hate speech laws cover to include the following: age; caste; color; disability; ethnicity; family responsibilities; gender; gender identity; housing status; national origin; race; refugee or immigration status; religious affiliation; serious illness; sex; sexual orientation; socioeconomic class and status; source of income; status as a victim of domestic violence, sexual violence, or stalking; and, weight and size.  </p><p>Last year, we wrote about how we address <a href="safety/how-trust-safety-addresses-violent-extremism-on-discord.html">Violent Extremism on Discord</a>. We are deeply committed to our work in this space and have updated our Violent Extremism Policy to prohibit any kind of support, promotion, or organization of violent extremist groups or ideologies. We worked closely with a violent extremism subject-matter expert to update this policy and will continue to work with third-party organizations like the <a href="https://gifct.org/">Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism</a> and the <a href="https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/networks/european-union-internet-forum-euif_en">European Union Internet Forum</a> to ensure it is enforced properly.</p></div><div class="w-richtext"><h2><strong>Financial Scams, Fraud Services, and Malicious Conduct</strong></h2><p>During 2022, we invested significantly in how we combat criminal activity on Discord. In February, we released two blogs to help users <a href="safety/common-scams-what-to-look-out-for.html">identify</a> and <a href="safety/protecting-users-from-scams-on-discord.html">protect themselves against</a> scams on Discord. Alongside these, we developed a Financial Scams Policy which prohibits three types of common scams: identity scams, investment scams, and financial scams. We will take action against users who scam others or use Discord to coordinate scamming operations. In the case of users who have been the victim of fraudulent activity, we recommend they report the activity to Discord and contact law enforcement, who will be able to follow up with us for more information if it helps their investigation. </p><p>Under our new Fraud Services Policy, we&#x27;ve expanded our definitions of what constitutes fraudulent behavior. We will take action against users who engage in reselling stolen or ill-gotten digital goods or are involved in coordinated efforts to defraud businesses or engage in price gouging, forgery, or money laundering.</p><p>We also do not allow any kind of activity that could damage or compromise the security of an account, computer network, or system under our updated Malicious Conduct Policy. We will take action against users who use Discord to host or distribute malware, or carry out phishing attempts and denial-of-service attacks against others.</p></div><div class="w-richtext"><h2><strong>What’s Next</strong></h2><p>User safety is our top priority and we’re committed to ensuring Discord continues to be a safe and welcoming place. We regularly evaluate and assess our policies in collaboration with experts, industry-leading groups, and partner organizations. We look forward to continuing our work in this important area and plan to share further updates down the road.</p></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div></div></div><div role="listitem" class="article_item w-dyn-item"><div data-w-id="bda883a0-f35d-54dc-c9d8-9a948cf6ba8a" class="academy_lesson-item"><div class="category_name">Safety</div><div class="academy_lesson-wr safety"><div id="w-node-f756a1bd-5d4e-c3f9-b614-be1730d80967-d9fcf281" class="creator-card-image-wrapper safety"><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/625fe439fb70a9d901e138ab/64995e7a60ef2bfe51726eef_2306SCLBlogHeader1.svg" loading="lazy" alt="" class="creator-card_image safety"/></div><div id="w-node-_6c63ba4f-4953-51fe-5d73-9782abcbcba6-d9fcf281" class="safety-item-content"><div class="text-blue safety">Safety</div><h2 style="color:rgb(44,47,51)" class="ginto-700-32 left-creator safety card-title">How Discord Prevents and Removes Spam</h2><div class="w-dyn-list"><div role="list" class="creator_topics-list w-dyn-items"><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><a href="safeties-topics/user-safety.html" class="topic_item w-inline-block"><div>User Safety</div></a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><a href="safeties-topics/server-safety.html" class="topic_item w-inline-block"><div>Server Safety</div></a></div></div></div></div></div><a href="safety/our-work-to-prevent-spam.html" class="academy_lesson-card"></a></div><div class="item-content"><div class="w-richtext"><h4><strong>The work we&#x27;ve done</strong></h4><p>We invested a substantial amount of time and resources into combating spam in 2022, disabling <strong>141,087,602</strong> accounts for spam or spam-related offenses, with a proactive removal rate of 99%, before we receive a user report.</p><p>We observed a significant increase in the number of accounts disabled during the third quarter of 2022, leading to an elevated but lower fourth quarter, and then to a substantial decrease in the first quarter of 2023.

That hash—and not the illegal imagery itself—is stored in a database that serves as a reference point for online detection efforts.</p><p>At Discord, we proactively scan images using hashing algorithms (including PhotoDNA) to detect known CSAM. For example, if someone uploads an image that matches against known CSAM that has been previously reported, we automatically detect it, remove it, and flag it for internal review. When we confirm that someone attempted to share illegal imagery, we remove the content, permanently ban them from our platform, and report them to NCMEC, who subsequently works with law enforcement. </p><p>There are more than <a href="https://www.missingkids.org/ourwork/impact">6.3 million hashes of CSAM</a> in NCMEC’s hash database and more than <a href="https://safer.io/how-it-works/">29 million hashes of CSAM</a> contained in databases from around the world. That gives the tech industry a strong foundation for stopping the spread of this harmful material on our platforms. But there’s one key limitation: it only detects exact or similar copies of images that are already logged in the database. This means that predatory actors will try to exploit this weakness with unknown CSAM that has yet to be seen or logged, indicating that there is either a likelihood of active abuse, or the images were synthetically generated using AI.</p></div><div class="w-richtext"><h3><strong>Machine learning helps us stop CSAM at scale</strong></h3><p>Unknown CSAM has continually plagued our industry and our team felt it was important to advance our own detection capabilities. We started with an open-source model that can analyze images to understand what they are depicting. Our engineers experimented and found that we could use this model to not only determine how similar one image is to another, but due to the semantic understanding of the model, it also demonstrated promising results for novel CSAM detection.</p><p>When we find a match, we follow the same process that we use for PhotoDNA matches: A human reviews it to verify if it is an instance of CSAM. If it is, it’s reported to NCMEC and added to the PhotoDNA database. From that point, the newly verified image can be detected automatically across platforms. This speeds up the review process, expands the database of known CSAM, and makes everyone better and faster at blocking CSAM over time. This is a major advancement in the effort to detect, report, and stop the spread of CSAM.</p><p>At a recent <a href="https://www.technologycoalition.org/">Tech Coalition</a> hackathon, engineers from Discord and other tech companies collaborated on ways we can work together to identify new forms of CSAM that evade existing detection methods. During this collaboration, we were able to work to make the AI-powered detection mechanism we built open-source. At Discord, we believe safety shouldn’t be proprietary or a competitive advantage. Our hope is that by making this technology open source, we can bring new capabilities and protections to all tech platforms, especially newer companies that don’t yet have established trust and safety teams.</p><p>This is part of our work alongside the <a href="https://www.technologycoalition.org/newsroom/announcing-lantern">Lantern</a> program, which is committed to stopping people from evading CSAM detection across platforms. Together, we’re working to increase prevention and detection methods, accelerate identification processes, share information on predatory tactics, and strengthen our collective reporting to authorities.</p><p>Ultimately, this is an ideal use of machine learning technology. It’s important to note, though, that human expertise and judgment is still involved. Our expert staff continues to review anything that’s not an exact match with PhotoDNA, because the stakes are high and we need to get it right. What matters most is that the combined efforts of machine learning and human expertise are making it harder than ever for predatory actors to evade detection.</p></div><div class="w-richtext"><h3><strong>We’re working to build a safer internet. It’s in our DNA.</strong></h3><p>Safety is a top priority at Discord. It’s reflected in our personnel: roughly 15% of our staff is dedicated to safety. These teams work to ensure our platform, features, and policies result in a positive and safe place for our users to hang out and build community.</p></div><div class="w-richtext"><h3><strong>We’re stronger together</strong></h3><p>The safety landscape is continually shifting. There are always new challenges emerging, and no single entity can tackle them alone.</p><p>Our industry can lead by sharing tools, intelligence, and best practices. We also need to work collaboratively with policymakers, advocacy groups, and academics to fully understand emerging threats and respond to them. Initiatives like Lantern and organizations like the Tech Coalition represent the kind of collaborative efforts that make it possible for us all to better stay ahead of bad actors and work together towards a universally safe online experience for everyone.</p></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty

It has since expanded into an opportunity for industry, government, and civil society to come together to share online safety and digital well-being best practices.</p><p>Making the internet a better, safer place for everyone is a tall task — and we know we can’t do it alone. Last year, as part of our ongoing partnership with the National Parent Teacher Association, we co-hosted an event featuring some of our teen moderators talking about belonging and mental health in online spaces. We’ve continued this partnership with the <a href="https://www.pta.org/home/programs/connected/build-up-and-belong#:~:text=National%20PTA%20has%20teamed%20up,students%2C%20teachers%2C%20and%20educators">PTA Connected: Build up and Belong Program</a>. This program helps families explore the use of technology as a communication and relationship tool, discusses ways to build belonging and positive communities in our digital world, teaches how to navigate privacy and safety on digital platforms, and helps families have interactive conversations about online scenarios, experiences and expectations. </p><p>We’re committed to helping build a safer internet on Safer Internet Day and beyond. To continue that mission, Discord has partnered with several international leaders in the online safety space. </p><h3><strong>Our Work with NoFiltr</strong></h3><p>This year, we’re teaming up with <a href="https://nofiltr.org/">NoFiltr</a> to help educate Discord users on the importance of safer internet practices to empower people to use Discord and other platforms in a smart and healthy manner. One of the ways we’ll be working together is by engaging with NoFiltr’s Youth Innovation Council to co-develop educational resources that connect to users where they are.</p><p>For this year’s Safer Internet Day, Discord and NoFiltr, with help from the Youth Innovation Council, are launching the “What’s Your Online Digital Role?” quiz. We believe that everyone can play a part in helping make online communities a safe and inclusive space, and this interactive quiz can help you figure out what role best suits you when it comes to being a part of and building a safe community. Take the <a href="http://www.nofiltr.org/quizzes/SaferInternetDay">quiz here</a> to find out.</p><h3><strong>International Partnerships and Public Policy Roundtable</strong></h3><p>Discord is partnering with Childnet UK and Internet Sans Crainte, two European Safer Internet Centers dedicated to increasing awareness and education about better online safety practices for youth.</p><p>In addition, we’ll be hosting a roundtable event in Brussels where policymakers, civil society thought leaders, and industry partners will come together to share insights, discuss challenges, and discuss steps we can take together to make Discord and the internet a safer place for young people.</p></div><div class="w-richtext"><h2>Engaging our Communities with Educational Activities</h2><p>We also wanted to provide materials and tools that everyone can use to help facilitate healthy and open conversation about online safety — it’s not so easy approaching difficult or sensitive topics when it comes to talking about your experiences online.</p><p>To help kick start these important discussions in a more approachable way, we’ve made a print-at-home fortune teller filled with questions and icebreaker prompts that can help you lead a conversation about better digital health and safer online practices.</p><figure class="w-richtext-figure-type- "><div><img src="../assets-global.website-files.com/625fe439fb70a9d901e138ab/649a6ef4da7ef835f650d751_63e19ac67455ed81e0553154_-kTFXbdpHmkYDLB9BZ83t1lvepcRFaMN8hGXIyAxnTxsyTiTqt7snPWhAIGDvv8qYD1gdU9qFsQhOv6__SOTqEaxAWNqMO5CgF1Th_AItbNnAfXJgpvG" alt="A printable activity about online safety.

Our teams are always working to make Discord an even more accessible and welcoming place to hang out online with your friends and build your community. Here are a couple of safety highlights from the last year:</p><h3><strong>AutoMod: Making Your Communities Safer Has Never Been Easier</strong></h3><p>In June, we debuted our new automated moderation tool, AutoMod, for community owners and admins looking for an easier way to keep communities and conversations welcoming and to empower them to better handle bad actors who distribute malicious language, harmful scams or links, and spam. </p><p>Today, AutoMod is hard at work in over 390,000 servers, reducing the workload for thousands of community moderators everywhere. So far, we’ve removed over 20 million unwanted messages — that’s 20 million less actions keeping moderators away from actually enjoying and participating in the servers they tend to. Check out our<a href="blog/automod-launch-automatic-community-moderation.html"> AutoMod blog post</a> if you’re interested in getting AutoMod up and running in your community.</p><h3><strong>The Great Spam Removal</strong></h3><p>Spam is a problem on Discord, and we treat this issue with the same level as any other problem that impacts your ability to talk and hang out on Discord. That’s why this year, we’ve increased the amount of time and resources into refining our policies and operational procedures to more efficiently and accurately target bad actors. We’ve had over 140 million spam takedowns in 2022, and we’ll continue to remove spam from our platform in the future.

We also get reports where a person demands we ban another person for “calling them a poopyhead,” while other times someone is being doxxed or in danger of self-harm and a friend of theirs reaches out to us.</p><p>Further complicating things, we also get reports from people who use a combination of false information, edited screenshots, socially engineered situations, or mass reports in an attempt to get a person banned or server deleted. <strong>We don’t act without clear evidence, and we gather as much information as possible to make informed, evidence-based decisions</strong> that take into account the context behind anything that’s posted. We’ll talk about some of the hard decisions we face later in this blog.</p></div><div class="w-richtext"><h2>Questions that Trust and Safety deals with: case examples</h2><p>In many situations, what happened is pretty obvious — a person has raided a server to post shock or gore content, they’re posting someone’s private information, or they’re directly threatening to harm someone in real life.</p><p>There are other cases where the situation is not so simple. Sometimes, parts of a conversation have been deleted, a slur is used as an act of reclamation, or someone is distributing a hack to a game on Discord that is generally used for cosmetic purposes — but could be used to cheat under certain conditions.</p><p>The Trust and Safety team seeks out context to best evaluate what’s going on even when things seem ambiguous. To illustrate the complexity of Trust and Safety’s decision making, see the three scenarios below and the accompanying considerations.</p><h3>Situation 1: Bilateral Harassment</h3><blockquote><em>Two people report each other for bad behavior. One of them clearly started the harassment, while the other escalated it. It starts out with simple insults, but they’re not willing to block each other.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>Eventually, it escalates to where one threatens to shoot the other’s dog and the other responds by making a sexual threat towards the initial person’s boyfriend.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>Meanwhile, they’re doing this in a channel that has plenty of other people in it, some of whom are clearly uncomfortable with the escalation, and one of those bystanders in the server writes in too, asking us to do something about it.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>Finally, not only is the owner of the server not doing anything, they’re actually egging the two people on, further escalating the situation.</em></blockquote><h3>Situation 1: Questions Trust and Safety considers</h3><p>Who should we take action on? Is it the person that started it? The person that escalated to a threat first? Or is it both people, even though each believes the other is at fault? Both people could’ve solved it by blocking the other — should we take any action at all?</p><p>How much do we believe each person felt threatened by the other person and thought the only reasonable thing to do was to keep engaging?</p><p>Should we also take action on the server owner in some way for egging them on instead of defusing the situation? If we do take action on the server owner, what should it be? A warning? What if one of the server members reports that the owner was privately messaging the two people in order to keep the feud going? Should we punish the server owner instead of the two people?</p><h3>Situation 2: Ban Appeal Specificity</h3><blockquote><em>Someone is banned for messaging people across servers a combination of racial slurs and spam. This person contacts us to appeal their ban.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>First, we inform them of the specific Community Guideline they have violated. Then, the banned person asks which specific message led to the ban. They insist they’ve done nothing wrong and never violated the Community Guidelines.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>They claim they’ve been an upstanding citizen, are in twenty different Discord servers, and have a host of users that can speak on their behalf. They insist it’s a false ban based on false reporting.</em></blockquote><blockquote><em>Finally, they enlist some of those people to write in and tell us that the person was maliciously reported. They demand we overturn the ban immediately.</em></blockquote><h3>Situation 2: Questions Trust and Safety considers</h3><p>Is the banned person acting in good faith? Do they legitimately not understand how they violated our Community Guidelines?</p><p>Are they simply trying to identify the reporter? Should we provide vague information? Will the banned person continue arguing that whatever messages we have are insufficient?</p><p>How do we respond to the supporters that are writing in about this ban? How much information should they get about the situation?</p><h3>Situation 3: DMs from ‘Discord’</h3><blockquote>Someone worriedly reaches out to us about a DM they received from another person claiming to be Discord staff. The DM is a warning that their messages are being monitored and that if they continued, the authorities will be contacted. They ask us if the message is real.</blockquote><blockquote>While the DM isn’t from Discord, the person pretending to be Discord staff contacts us and admits to sending those messages from an alt. The impersonator claims they lied in order to dissuade the initial person from self-harming.</blockquote><blockquote>When we investigate, it does appear to be true. The initial person was talking about some harmful activity and after receiving the impersonated warning, they’ve completely stopped.</blockquote><h3>Situation 3: Questions Trust and Safety considers</h3><p>Impersonating Discord staff is a violation of our Community Guidelines. Most of the time, impersonators engage in extremely harmful behavior and will receive an immediate ban.</p><p>In this case, it appears the impersonator has good intentions. Should we take action on the impersonator? Do we just warn them not to do it again? Do we just let it go?</p><p>On the other side, should we confirm with the initial person that the message was not from Discord? If we do that, does this encourage them to continue to self-harm?</p><p>All of this is a lot to consider and Discord’s Trust and Safety Team is tasked with answering questions like these hundreds of times a day, seven days a week, with each situation different and each one with real people who will be impacted by what we choose to do.</p></div><div class="w-richtext"><h2>How do we make new policy?</h2><p>When creating new policy, we evaluate all available information on that topic to understand what the best policy is. We look at academic research on the topic, what other companies do, and what users, non-users, and experts in the field think. We consider whether something is illegal, whether something is harmful, and how scalable our operations are. We leverage all of these checks and balances to remove as much personal bias or interest as possible. We believe we have a deep-seated responsibility to be objective about what we allow or restrict on Discord.</p><p>Our decision-making process prioritizes safety from harm. We strive to create a platform that is safe and inclusive, regardless of someone’s race, ethnicity, gender, gender identity, religion, and sexual orientation. After all, everyone can play and enjoy games, and Discord should be that place where anyone can find someone else to play with.</p><p>Along with thinking about how we can prevent harm to people on Discord, we consider scale, privacy, nuance, and freedom when developing policy.</p><h3>Scale</h3><p>How can we scale the enforcement of this policy to our enormous user base? A policy that sounds good but isn’t enforced isn’t actually good policy. It’s important not just to talk the talk but to also walk the walk.</p><h3>Privacy</h3><p>How can we balance our ability to investigate potential bad things on Discord while our users have and should have a right to privacy?</p><p>In the real world, Big Brother isn’t watching you inside your home during a conversation with two of your friends, even if you’re up to no good. Should we keep using that model on Discord if it means that people have the ability to chat about bad things, and that Discord may be used for bad actions? Are people okay with automated software or other humans reading their private conversations to stop potential bad actors?</p><h3>Nuance</h3><p>If a potential harm is very hard to discern, is it Discord’s place as a platform to moderate a particular form of speech?</p><p>If something is reported frequently and we can’t conclude whether it’s definitely bad (even though users can take some action to protect themselves), should we rely on them to do so?</p><p>If someone opens up a server and promises rewards to its members, but people complain that they’re not fulfilling those assurances, should we forbid offering rewards?</p><h3>Freedom</h3><p>With all this said, how can we make sure that good people don’t feel like we’re censoring them? Just because we don’t understand a hobby or interest, does that give us the permission to ban it from our platform?</p><p>After considering scale, privacy, nuance, and freedom, we outline all possible outcomes to the best of our ability, and try to find the solution with the best possible answers to those questions.</p><p>Eventually, after thorough discussion, research, and talking to third parties, we make our way to a policy document. To get more perspective, we circulate that document to other Discord staff members who aren’t on Trust and Safety and ask for their feedback.</p><p>Finally, we arrive at a conclusion, implement the policy, and monitor it. If we receive new information or the policy isn’t having the impact we’d hoped, we adjust our policy to make sure that it’s effective. We’re constantly listening, observing, and wanting to do better, and our policy reflects this as a living, breathing, work in progress.</p><p>On that note, we wanted to talk about a recent change we’ve made to uphold our commitment to listening to community feedback.</p></div><div class="w-richtext"><h2>Changing policy on cub porn</h2><p>Over the past couple of weeks, posts have appeared inquiring about Discord’s stance on a niche area of NSFW policy, which is cub porn. A screenshot of an email we sent about a year ago in February 2018 has garnered significant commentary and criticism about our policy.</p><p>As our Community Guidelines state, the following immediately results in account deletion:</p><ul role="list"><li>Sharing content related to minors that is sexually suggestive or violent. Do not share or post links to images that depict minors or underage individuals engaged in violent, sexually suggestive, pornographic, shameful, or otherwise inappropriate situations.</li></ul><p>Furthermore, the following will lead to content removal and a warning (or ban depending on the severity):</p><ul role="list"><li>Sharing illustrated or digitally altered pornography which depicts minors (such as lolicon or shotacon).</li></ul><p>One major reason this policy is in place on Discord is because there is a federal law in the United States against the sexualized images of minors, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1466A" target="_blank">which includes cartoons and drawings</a>. You can see this distinction in action on Google Images which does not show results for lolicon but does show results for cub porn.</p><p>Discord’s current policy is that anything human or humanoid is forbidden (including anthropomorphized characters). This includes most cub pornography.</p><p>While this is already more restrictive than what the law requires, we’ve received feedback that we’re not comprehensive enough here. <strong>As of today, we’re changing our policy to ban all cub porn. This means the sexualization of minor ban now extends to non-humanoid animals and mythological creatures as long as they appear to be underage. </strong>We’re adding “cub” to the list of categories, after lolicon and shotacon, to our Community Guidelines to clarify that this content is not allowed on Discord.</p></div><div class="w-richtext"><h2>Releasing a Transparency Report for the First Time</h2><p>It’s really important to us that the millions of people who use Discord every day can trust our decisions. We want this blog to provide transparency on our processes, and we’re going to continue this by further providing a more in-depth view into our actions as a team with Discord’s first transparency report.</p><p>In this report, we want to provide more information about our content moderation outcomes, such as how many actions are taken a month, how many users are actioned, and what is causing their removal from the platform.</p><p>We think that transparency is good. It will shine more light on the work we do, help maintain accountability, and guide conversations about where we should be spending our time to get better. We’re looking to release our first report by the end of April, and want to continue releasing them quarterly after that.</p></div><div class="w-richtext"><h2>Some parting words</h2><p>These last couple of weeks, we received a lot of feedback about our policies and decisions. We’ve also received death threats and personal attacks directed at those who put their heart and soul into keeping you all safe on Discord.</p><p>As time goes on and Discord grows even larger, there will likely be more situations where reasonable people may disagree on the best policy to have. When this happens, we hope to engage in constructive dialogue, not personal attacks or threats.</p><p>Lastly, we’ve always taken feedback on all of our decisions, from what features to build all the way to the policies that govern what is acceptable conduct on Discord. We hope this blog shows you how our Trust and Safety team keeps Discord a safe place to bring people together around games.</p><p>We look forward to continuing this dialogue with you.</p></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div></div></div><div role="listitem" class="article_item w-dyn-item"><div data-w-id="bda883a0-f35d-54dc-c9d8-9a948cf6ba8a" class="academy_lesson-item"><div class="category_name w-dyn-bind-empty"></div><div class="academy_lesson-wr safety"><div id="w-node-f756a1bd-5d4e-c3f9-b614-be1730d80967-d9fcf281" class="creator-card-image-wrapper safety"><img src="../assets-global.website-files.com/625fe439fb70a9d901e138ab/650a164de90cff465e89bafc_Tarot_SafetyBlogBanner.png" loading="lazy" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 90vw, 280px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/625fe439fb70a9d901e138ab/650a164de90cff465e89bafc_Tarot_SafetyBlogBanner-p-500.png 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/625fe439fb70a9d901e138ab/650a164de90cff465e89bafc_Tarot_SafetyBlogBanner-p-800.png 800w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/625fe439fb70a9d901e138ab/650a164de90cff465e89bafc_Tarot_SafetyBlogBanner.png 1200w" class="creator-card_image safety"/></div><div id="w-node-_6c63ba4f-4953-51fe-5d73-9782abcbcba6-d9fcf281" class="safety-item-content"><div class="text-blue safety w-dyn-bind-empty"></div><h2 style="color:rgb(44,47,51)" class="ginto-700-32 left-creator safety card-title">Navigating Online Boundaries With Your Teen</h2><div class="w-dyn-list"><div role="list" class="creator_topics-list w-dyn-items"><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><a href="safeties-topics/parents-and-teens.html" class="topic_item w-inline-block"><div>Parents and Teens</div></a></div></div></div></div></div><a href="safety/navigating-online-boundaries-with-your-teen.html" class="academy_lesson-card"></a></div><div class="item-content"><div class="w-richtext"><p>We’re committed to making Discord a safe place for teens to hang out with their friends online. While they’re doing their thing and we’re doing our part to keep them safe, sometimes it’s hard for parents to know what’s actually going on in their teens’ online lives.</p><p>Teens navigate the online world with a level of expertise that is often underestimated by the adults in their lives. For parents, it may be a hard lesson to fathom—that their teens know best. But why wouldn’t they? Every teen is their own leading expert in their life experiences (as we all are!). But growing up online, this generation is particularly adept at what it means to make new friends, find community, express their authentic selves, and test boundaries—all online.</p><p>But that doesn’t mean teens don’t need adults’ help when it comes to setting healthy digital boundaries. And it doesn’t mean parents can’t be a guide for cultivating safe, age-appropriate spaces. It’s about finding the right balance between giving teens agency while creating the right moments to check in with them.</p><p>One of the best ways to do that is to encourage more regular, open and honest conversations with your teen about staying safe online. Here at Discord, we’ve developed tools to help that process, like our <a href="blog/discord-family-center-stay-connected-with-your-teen.html">Family Center</a>: an opt-in program that makes it easy for parents and guardians to be informed about their teen’s Discord activity while respecting their autonomy.</p><p>Here are a few more ways to kick off online safety discussions.</p></div><div class="w-richtext"><h4>Let your curiosity—not your judgment—guide you</h4><p>If a teen feels like they could get in trouble for something, they won’t be honest with you. So go into these conversations from a place of curiosity first, rather than judgment.</p><p>Here are a few conversation-starters:</p><ul role="list"><li><em>Give me a tour of your Discord. Tell me what you&#x27;re seeing. </em></li><li><em>What kind of communities are you in? Where are you having the most fun? </em></li><li><em>What are your settings like? Do you feel like people can randomly reach out to you? </em></li><li><em>Have there been times when you&#x27;ve been confused by how someone interacted with you? Were you worried about some of the messages that you&#x27;ve seen in the past?</em></li></ul><p>Teens will be less likely to share if they feel like parents just don’t get it, so asking open questions like these will foster more conversation. Questions rooted in blame can also backfire: the teen may not be as forthcoming because they feel like the adult is already gearing up to punish them.</p><p>Read more <a href="safety/360044154611-talking-about-online-safety-with-your-teen.html">helpful prompts for talking with your teen about online safety</a> in our Discord Safety Center.</p></div><div class="w-richtext"><h4>View your teen as an expert of their experience online</h4><p>Our goal at Discord is to make it a place where teens can talk and hang out with their friends in a safe, fun way. It’s a place where teens have power and agency, where they get to feel like they own something.</p><p>Just because your teen is having fun online doesn&#x27;t mean you have to give up your parental role. Parents and trusted adults in a teen’s life are here to coach and guide them, enabling them to explore themselves and find out who they are—while giving them the parameters by which to do so.</p><p>On Discord, some of those boundaries could include:</p><ul role="list"><li>Turning on Direct Message Requests to make sure strangers can’t message them on larger servers without going to a separate inbox to be approved, first.</li><li>Creating different server profiles for servers that aren’t just their close friends. You and your teen can discuss how much information should be disclosed on different servers, for example by using different nicknames or disclosing pronouns on a server-by-server basis.</li></ul><p>Using Discord’s <a href="blog/discord-family-center-stay-connected-with-your-teen.html">Family Center</a> feature so you can be more informed and involved in your teens’ online life without prying.</p></div><div class="w-richtext"><h4><strong>Create more excuses to have safety conversations</strong></h4><p>At Discord, we’ve created several tools to help parents stay informed and in touch with their teens online, including this <a href="https://connectsafely.org/discord/">Parent’s Guide to Discord</a> and the <a href="safety-family-center.html">Family Center</a>.</p><p>In the spirit of meeting teens where they are, we’ve also introduced a lighthearted way to spur conversations through a set of <a href="safety-tarot.html">digital safety tarot cards</a>. Popular with Gen Z, tarot cards are a fun way for teens to self-reflect and find meaning in a world that can feel out of control.</p><p>The messages shown in the cards encourage teens to be kind and to use their intuition and trust their instincts. They remind teens to fire up their empathy, while also reminding them it’s OK to block those who bring you down.</p><p>And no, these cards will (unfortunately) not tell you your future! But they’re a fun way to initiate discussions about online safety and establish a neutral, welcoming space for your teen to share their concerns. They encourage teens to share real-life experiences and stories of online encounters, both positive and negative. The idea is to get young people talking, and parents listening.</p></div><div class="w-richtext"><h4>Know that help is always available</h4><p>Sometimes, even as adults, it&#x27;s easy to get in over your head online. Through <a href="blog/bridging-gen-z-mental-health-gaps.html#:~:text=If%20you%20or%20someone%20you,about%20Crisis%20Text%20Line%20here">our research with parents and teens</a>, we found that while 30% of parents said their Gen Zer’s emotional and mental health had taken a turn for the worse in the past few years, 55% of Gen Z said it. And while some teens acknowledged that being extremely online can contribute to that, more reported that online communications platforms, including social media, play a positive role in their life through providing meaningful community connection. Understanding healthy digital boundaries and how they can impact mental wellbeing is important, no matter if you’re a teen, parent, or any age in-between.</p><p>When it comes to addressing the unique safety needs of each individual, there are resources, such as Crisis Text Line.

Creating a safe environment on Discord is essential to achieve this, and is one of the ways we prevent misuse of our platform. <a href="safety.html">Safety</a> is at the core of everything we do and a primary area of investment as a business: </p><ol role="list"><li>We invest talent and resources towards safety efforts. From Safety and Policy to Engineering, Data, and Product teams, about 15 percent of all Discord employees are dedicated to working on safety. Creating a safer internet is at the heart of our collective mission. </li></ol><ol start="2" role="list"><li>We continue to innovate how we scale safety mechanisms, with a focus on proactive detection. Millions of people around the world use Discord every day, the vast majority are engaged in positive ways, but we take action on multiple fronts to address bad behavior and harmful content. For example, we use PhotoDNA image hashing to identify inappropriate images; we use advanced technology like machine learning models to identify and remedy offending content; and we empower and equip <a href="safety/360044103531-role-of-administrators-and-moderators-on-discord.html">community moderators </a>with tools and training to uphold our policies in their communities. You can read more about our safety initiatives and priorities <strong>below.</strong></li></ol><ol start="3" role="list"><li>Our ongoing work to protect users is conducted in collaboration and partnership with experts who share our mission to create a safer internet. We partner with a number of organizations to jointly confront challenges impacting internet users at large. For example, we partner with the Family Online Safety Institute, an international non-profit that endeavors to make the online world safer for children and families. We also cooperate with the National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (NCMEC), the Tech Coalition, and the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism.</li></ol><p>The fight against bad actors on communications platforms is unlikely to end soon, and our approach to safety is guided by the following principles:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Design for Safety</strong>: We make our products safe spaces by design and by default. Safety is and will remain part of the core product experience at Discord.</li><li><strong>Prioritize the Highest Harms:</strong> We prioritize issues that present the highest harm to our platform and our users. This includes harm to our users and society (e.g. sexual exploitation, <a href="safety/how-trust-safety-addresses-violent-extremism-on-discord.html">violence</a>, sharing of illegal content) and platform integrity harm (e.g. spam, account take-over, malware). </li><li><strong>Design for Privacy:</strong> We carefully balance privacy and safety on the platform. We believe that users should be able to tailor their Discord experience to their preferences, including <a href="privacy.html">privacy</a>.</li><li><strong>Embrace Transparency &amp; Knowledge Sharing:</strong> We continue to educate users, join coalitions, build relationships with experts, and publish our safety learnings including our <a href="safety-transparency-reports/2022-q4.html">Transparency Reports</a>.</li></ul><p>Underpinning all of this are two important considerations: our overall approach towards content moderation and our investments in technology solutions to keep our users safe. </p></div><div class="w-richtext"><h3><strong>Our Approach to Content Moderation </strong></h3><p>We currently employ three levers to moderate user content on Discord, while mindful of user privacy: </p><ul role="list"><li><strong>User Controls:</strong> Our product architecture provides each user with fundamental control over their experience on Discord including who they communicate with, what content they see, and what communities they join or create. </li><li><strong>Platform Moderation:</strong> Our universal <a href="guidelines.html">Community Guidelines</a> apply to all content and every interaction on the platform. These fundamental rules are enforced by Discord on an ongoing basis through a mix of proactive and reactive work. </li><li><strong>Community Moderation:</strong> Server owners and volunteer community moderators define and enforce norms of behavior for their communities that can go beyond the Discord Community Guidelines. We enable our community moderators with technology (tools like <a href="blog/new-anti-spam-raid-automod-safety-update.html">AutoMod</a>) as well as training and peer support (the Discord Moderator Academy).</li></ul><p>There is constant innovation taking place within and beyond Discord to improve how companies can effectively scale and deliver content moderation. In the future, our approach will continue to evolve, as we are constantly finding new ways to do better for our users.<br/></p></div><div class="w-richtext"><h3><strong>Our Technology Solutions </strong></h3><p>We believe that in the long term, machine learning will be an essential component of safety solutions. In 2021, we acquired Sentropy, a leader in AI-powered moderation systems, to advance our work in this domain. We will continue to balance technology with the judgment and contextual assessment of highly trained employees, as well as continuing to maintain our strong stance on user privacy.</p><p>Here is an overview of some of our key investments in technology:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Safety Rules Engine</strong>: The rules engine allows our teams to evaluate user activities such as registrations, server joins, and other metadata. We can then analyze patterns of problematic behavior to make informed decisions and take uniform actions like user challenges or bans.</li><li><a href="blog/new-anti-spam-raid-automod-safety-update.html"><strong>AutoMod</strong></a>: AutoMod allows community moderators to block messages with certain keywords, automatically block dangerous links, and identify harmful messages using machine learning. This technology empowers community moderators to keep their communities safe.</li><li><strong>Visual Safety Platform: </strong>This is a service that can identify hashes of objectionable images such as child sexual abuse material (CSAM), and check all image uploads to Discord against databases of known objectionable images.</li></ul></div><div class="w-richtext"><h3><strong>Our Partnerships</strong></h3><p>In the field of online safety, we are inspired by the spirit of cooperation across companies and civil society groups. We are proud to engage and learn from a wide range of companies and organizations including:</p><ul role="list"><li>National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children</li><li>Family Online Safety Institute</li><li>Tech Coalition</li><li>Crisis Text Line</li><li>Digital Trust &amp; Safety Partnership</li><li>Trust &amp; Safety Professionals Association </li><li>Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism</li></ul><p>This cooperation extends to our work with law enforcement agencies. When appropriate, Discord complies with information requests from law enforcement agencies while respecting the privacy and rights of our users. Discord also may disclose information to authorities in emergency situations when we possess a good faith belief that there is imminent risk of serious physical injury or death. You can read more about how Discord works with law enforcement <a href="safety/360044157931-Working-with-law-enforcement-2.html">here</a>.</p></div><div class="w-richtext"><h3><strong>Our Policy and

To summarize, this clause states that when there’s a disagreement between Discord and you, we’ll use an alternative dispute resolution process known as arbitration.</p><h3>Why did we change it?</h3><p>The current legal landscape in the United States is such that class action lawsuits can be abused. This clause was added because we are now operating a game store and subscription service for profit. Like many other companies, we are now a target for entities who wish to abuse the class action lawsuit.</p><p>If you’d like to learn more about the legal landscape, arbitration, and the potential abuse of class action lawsuits, we’ve included a handful of links in the <strong>Resources</strong> section at the bottom of this post.</p><h3>What does that mean for you?</h3><p>We think that people can disagree on whether or not arbitration is good in general or whether or not the class action system is one that is beneficial; we don’t think it’s completely black and white. In fact, we’re very interested in how <a href="https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=7d6ceae7-700a-4984-90ec-4d94ecfd5edd" target="_blank">Europe is approaching implementing class action lawsuits</a>, as their approach may mitigate the issues that the United States faces with them.</p><p>Because we don’t think it’s black and white, one of the things that we’ve implemented (which some of our competitors do not), is to allow you to opt out of this clause completely. We encourage you to opt out if you wish. <strong>You won’t be penalized in any way if you do so</strong>. At no point will we ever gate any features or take any action on users because they’ve opted out of arbitration.</p></div><div class="w-richtext"><h2>The Changes</h2><p>The following changes will be live sometime before October 20th, 2018.</p><h3>United States Exclusivity</h3><p>As we stated above in “Why did we change it,” our motivation for this change is because of the legal climate in the United States. To protect our users outside the United States, <strong>we’ve decided to modify this clause so that it only affects users in the United States. If you are outside of the United States, this clause does not apply to you. </strong>This means users outside the United States do not need to opt out if they were wanting to.</p><h3>Opt Out Extension</h3><p>Furthermore, every user was (or will be if they haven’t logged in yet) notified of changes to our Terms of Service on the date they were updated by a blue notification bar at the top of the Discord client. In hindsight, we should have provided notice of these changes much further in advance, so we apologize for that.</p><p>That said, much of the feedback we’ve received is that our community was not aware of these changes. To provide more opportunity for those who wish to opt out and for those who may have overlooked the notification bar, <strong>we’ve extended our opt out period from the initial 30 days to 90 days.</strong></p><h3><strong>How do I opt out?</strong></h3><p>Stated in our <a href="https://discordapp.com/terms" target="_blank">Terms of Service</a> under DISPUTE RESOLUTION:</p><blockquote>You have the right to opt out and not be bound by the provisions requiring arbitration by sending written notice of your decision to opt out to Discord by email to <a href="mailto:arbitration-opt-out@discord.com" target="_blank">arbitration-opt-out@discord.com</a>.</blockquote><p>Your opt out doesn’t need any specific template or form. It just needs the request to opt out and it must come from the email associated with your Discord account.</p><p>We want to reiterate — you will not be penalized in any way for opting out of arbitration. Again, we encourage you to do so if you wish to.</p><p>‍</p></div><div class="w-richtext"><h2>Wrapping Up</h2><p>Thanks again for your feedback — it’s important to us as a company that we hear from our community. We really appreciate that you all care so much to voice your opinions.

Not only do we intentionally build products that help to keep our users safer, but we also implement a Safety by Design practice, which includes a risk assessment process during the product development cycle that helps identify and mitigate potential risks to user safety.</p><p>This year, we made key investments that help teens, parents, and all of our users have a positive Discord experience:</p><ul role="list"><li>We launched <a href="safety/safer-place-for-teens.html">Teen Safety Assist</a>, which introduced new features aimed at better protecting teen users on Discord, including safety alerts when a user receives a DM  from someone for the first time, and content filters to blur media that may be sensitive. These features are default enabled for teen users. We collaborated with leading child safety organization <a href="https://www.thorn.org/">Thorn</a> to ensure this tool was grounded in the latest research and included language that resonates with teens. We plan to announce more features as part of this tool in 2024. </li><li>We developed a <a href="safety/safer-place-for-teens.html">Warning System</a> to help users more easily understand when and how they’ve broken Discord’s rules and provide them with resources to learn how to do better in the future. For teens specifically, this feature allows us to consider how they are learning and growing, giving them more opportunities to learn from mistakes rather than punishing them harshly for certain misbehaviors. Some violations are more serious than others, and in those cases, we’ll take the appropriate action, especially for violations related to violent extremism or sexualization of children.</li><li>As part of a Tech Coalition hackathon, we built and implemented a new <a href="safety/how-discord-leverages-machine-learning-to-fight-csam.html">Visual Safety Technology</a> called CLIP to detect unknown CSAM and AI-generated CSAM with positive results. We have made this technology open source, so that we can share our innovation with other organizations—without cost—and contribute to the broader fight against CSAM online. </li><li>We unveiled <a href="safety-family-centerdbfa.html?gclid=CjwKCAiAvJarBhA1EiwAGgZl0O9HtxjLsRoWyueqixzBlRA6Ii85azJAA6boFrAmvniS0qT6KymrwBoCxesQAvD_BwE">Family Center</a>, an in-app tool to help keep parents and guardians informed of how their teens use Discord while still giving teens autonomy and control over their experience. This is a pivotal step in helping parents and teens develop collaborative approaches to build positive online behaviors.</li><li>We made updates to Discord’s <a href="safety/safer-place-for-teens.html">Moderator Toolkit</a><strong>,</strong> equipping server moderators with new ways to proactively identify potentially unsafe activity, such as server raids and DM spam, and take swift actions as needed. </li><li>As a part of our regular process to review and update our policies, we partnered with leaders in the teen and child safety space to ensure our <a href="safety/commitment-to-teen-child-safety.html">teen and child safety policies</a> are crafted with the latest research, best practices, and expertise in mind. For example, as part of our zero-tolerance policy for child sexual abuse, we added a clear distinction that we do not allow AI-generated photorealistic CSAM. We took a holistic and nuanced approach to these updates in order to better support and educate our teen users while continuing to make Discord a hostile environment for bad actors.</li></ul></div><div class="w-richtext"><h3><strong>Partnerships</strong></h3><p>We believe that everyone in the industry should share solutions, intelligence, and technology, which is why we continued to invest in furthering our partnerships with a number of safety organizations this year. These organizations help us to keep our platform and the internet safer by supplementing our expertise and insights and helping us to continue to advance cutting edge safety efforts.</p><p>As part of our extensive fight against child sexual abuse material (CSAM), we continued to deepen our partnership with the <a href="https://www.technologycoalition.org/">Tech Coalition</a>. I joined the Tech Coalition’s <a href="https://www.technologycoalition.org/newsroom/tech-coalition-executive-director-sean-litton-welcomes-the-2023-board-of-directors">Board of Directors and am </a>excited to help shape the organization’s future and continue to collaborate with industry leaders to combat online sexual abuse and exploitation.</p><p>One of the most exciting parts of our partnership with the Tech Coalition this year was the launch of <a href="https://www.technologycoalition.org/newsroom/announcing-lantern">Lantern, </a>a first-of-its-kind signal sharing program for companies to enhance and strengthen how we detect attempts to sexually exploit and abuse children and teens online. Discord joined other industry partners like Google, Mega, Meta, Quora, Roblox, Snap, and Twitch to share signals about activity we detect that violates our policies and utilize signals shared by other companies to surface violating activity on their platforms.</p><p>We also expanded our partnership with <a href="https://inhope.org/EN/articles/safety-discord-s-most-important-investment">INHOPE</a>, a global network combatting CSAM online. Through this partnership, we are better able to collaborate with the hotlines globally working to address this important issue.</p><p>We joined the <a href="https://www.iwf.org.uk/news-media/news/discord-steps-up-bid-to-rid-internet-of-appalling-child-sexual-abuse-imagery/">Internet Watch Foundation</a> (IWF), the UK’s frontline defense against the spread of online child sexual abuse imagery. By becoming a member, Discord will be able to deploy IWF’s world-leading services to keep the platform safer, including the IWF’s URL List and Keywords List, as well as its Non-Photographic URL and Hash Lists.</p><p>Discord also joined the <a href="https://www.christchurchcall.com/media-and-resources/news-and-updates/four-new-tech-firms-join-the-christchurch-call/">Christchurch Call,</a> a community of over 120 members worldwide with a shared goal of eliminating violent extremism online. Partnership and transparency are cornerstones of our effort to counter extremism and we are committed to working collectively with this global community to make the internet and the world a safer place.</p><p>Discord is <a href="https://ecnl.org/news/ecnl-and-discord-are-joining-forces-pilot-framework-meaningful-engagement">partnering</a> with the European Center for Not-for-Profit Law to lead a pilot project to implement their <a href="https://ecnl.org/sites/default/files/2023-03/Final Version FME with Copyright (2).pdf">Framework for Meaningful Engagement</a> (FME). ECNL’s expertise and the FME will help us build and deploy AI systems in support of our safety work.</p><p>We continued our important partnership with the National PTA around family engagement efforts. Through their <a href="https://www.pta.org/home/programs/connected/build-up-and-belong">Build Up and Belong program</a>, we supported local PTAs as they hosted events to help families build healthy digital habits and foster productive conversations about navigating online interactions. </p><p>Additionally, we are proud board members of <a href="https://dtspartnership.org/">Digital Trust &amp; Safety Partnership</a>, which gathers tech platforms to collaborate on and publish online safety best practices. This includes conducting audits of our policies and processes to ensure safety is built into our systems by design. We also are active members of the <a href="https://www.tspa.org/">Trust &amp; Safety Professional Association</a>, an organization that gathers Trust &amp; Safety professionals from around the world for training and to share best practices across the industry.</p></div><div class="w-richtext"><h3><strong>Looking to 2024 and beyond</strong></h3><p>As technologies continue to evolve, so does the dynamic safety landscape, presenting new challenges that no company or government can tackle alone. Continued industry investment in safety features must be made to ensure users on our platforms are safer. We can do this by evolving our features and policies to ensure they are up to date, holistic, and meet the needs of our users; regularly sharing knowledge and progress; and working collaboratively with each other and legislators, advocacy groups, and academics, to ensure a safer online experience for everyone.</p><p>While we’ve made a lot of progress over the last year, we know there is still much more we can and must do – on our own and in collaboration with others – to combat known and new threats. The work here never stops. As we look to the New Year, my team and I are as committed as ever to building on the important safety work we’ve done over the past twelve months, and we are confident that Discord will continue to be the best place for people to have fun online.</p></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div></div></div><div role="listitem" class="article_item w-dyn-item"><div data-w-id="bda883a0-f35d-54dc-c9d8-9a948cf6ba8a" class="academy_lesson-item"><div class="category_name">Policy</div><div class="academy_lesson-wr safety"><div id="w-node-f756a1bd-5d4e-c3f9-b614-be1730d80967-d9fcf281" class="creator-card-image-wrapper safety"><img src="../assets-global.website-files.com/625fe439fb70a9d901e138ab/64997dd2013d863c5c3b1d3d_6116bb551d28102630f9f17f_0_kF2QnaoPP31T5pxj.png" loading="lazy" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 90vw, 280px" srcset="https://assets-global.website-files.com/625fe439fb70a9d901e138ab/64997dd2013d863c5c3b1d3d_6116bb551d28102630f9f17f_0_kF2QnaoPP31T5pxj-p-500.png 500w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/625fe439fb70a9d901e138ab/64997dd2013d863c5c3b1d3d_6116bb551d28102630f9f17f_0_kF2QnaoPP31T5pxj-p-800.png 800w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/625fe439fb70a9d901e138ab/64997dd2013d863c5c3b1d3d_6116bb551d28102630f9f17f_0_kF2QnaoPP31T5pxj-p-1080.png 1080w, https://assets-global.website-files.com/625fe439fb70a9d901e138ab/64997dd2013d863c5c3b1d3d_6116bb551d28102630f9f17f_0_kF2QnaoPP31T5pxj.png 1600w" class="creator-card_image safety"/></div><div id="w-node-_6c63ba4f-4953-51fe-5d73-9782abcbcba6-d9fcf281" class="safety-item-content"><div class="text-blue safety">Policy</div><h2 style="color:rgb(44,47,51)" class="ginto-700-32 left-creator safety card-title">Welcome to Policy at Discord</h2><div class="w-dyn-list"><div role="list" class="creator_topics-list w-dyn-items"><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><a href="safeties-topics/policy.html" class="topic_item w-inline-block"><div>Policy</div></a></div></div></div></div></div><a href="safety/welcome-to-policy-at-discord.html" class="academy_lesson-card"></a></div><div class="item-content"><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div><div class="w-dyn-bind-empty w-richtext"></div></div></div><div role="listitem" class="article_item w-dyn-item"><div data-w-id="bda883a0-f35d-54dc-c9d8-9a948cf6ba8a" class="academy_lesson-item"><div class="category_name">Policy</div><div class="academy_lesson-wr safety"><div id="w-node-f756a1bd-5d4e-c3f9-b614-be1730d80967-d9fcf281" class="creator-card-image-wrapper safety"><img src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/625fe439fb70a9d901e138ab/6499609fd2f8a47134012bf9_2306_SCL_BlogHeader_6.svg" loading="lazy" alt="" class="creator-card_image safety"/></div><div id="w-node-_6c63ba4f-4953-51fe-5d73-9782abcbcba6-d9fcf281" class="safety-item-content"><div class="text-blue safety">Policy</div><h2 style="color:rgb(44,47,51)" class="ginto-700-32 left-creator safety card-title">Working with CARU to protect users on Discord</h2><div class="w-dyn-list"><div role="list" class="creator_topics-list w-dyn-items"><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><a href="safeties-topics/communications.html" class="topic_item w-inline-block"><div>Communications</div></a></div><div role="listitem" class="w-dyn-item"><a href="safeties-topics/partnerships.html" class="topic_item w-inline-block"><div>Partnerships</div></a></div></div></div></div></div><a href="safety/360057166133-working-with-caru-to-protect-users-on-discord.html" class="academy_lesson-card"></a></div><div class="item-content"><div class="w-richtext"><p>Protecting the privacy and safety of our users is of utmost importance to Discord.</p><p>Discord is a communications service for teens and adults who are looking to talk with their communities and friends online.
